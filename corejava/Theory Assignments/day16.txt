1.What is Collecion & its purpose 

-> Collection is single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).
->Collections gives programmer access to prepackaged data & manipulate data

3.Types of Collection 

-> List(Interface) : 
  
 - child interface of Collection
  
 - stores dublicate value 

 - Implement by ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack

->Set :
 - Sorted data
 -no dublicate data

->Map :
 - data & key
 -Unique Key Only

4. Diff between ArrayList & LinkedList 

-> Uses Dynamic array /uses doubly linked list 

-> manipulation slow / manipulation faster 

-> act as a list / act as a list & queue 

-> better for storeing & accessing data / better for manipulation

5. Diff between set (HashSet / TreeSet / LinkedHaShSet)
