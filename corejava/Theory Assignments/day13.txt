1)what are interfaces
->An interface is a reference type 
->collection of abstract methods
 
2)where can be use them,
->It is used to achieve total abstraction.
->To achieve multiple inheritance 

3)why it is important to use intefaced
->so that we can inherit/implement multiple classes

4)difference between interface and abstract class
->Abstract class	Interface
-> abstract and non-abstract methods / abstract methods & static methods 
-> doesn't support multiple inheritance / supports multiple inheritance.
->have final, non-final, static and non-static variables / has only static and final variables.
-> can provide the implementation of interface / can't provide the implementation of abstract class.

5)interfaces have IS-A or has-A relation
->Java Interface also represents the IS-A relationship.

6)can one interface extends other ?
->Yes 
->Example
public interface Football extends Sports {
   public void homeTeamScored(int points);
   public void visitingTeamScored(int points);
   public void endOfQuarter(int quarter);
}

7)diff between IS-A and HAS-A relation
->An IS-A relationship is inheritances / HAS - A relationship is composition

8)wat is loosely coupled and tightly couple methodology
->Loose coupling means reducing the dependencies of a class that uses the different classes directly. 
->Tight coupling means classes and objects are dependent on one another

9)intefaces are falling under which category (loosely-coupled and tightly couple)
-> loosely coupled
